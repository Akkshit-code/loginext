# Food Delivery Simulation

This project simulates a **food delivery assignment system** where multiple customers place orders, and delivery boys are assigned based on availability.
If no delivery boy is available at the time of order, the customer receives `"No Food :-("`.

##  Problem Statement

- There are **N customers** and **M delivery boys**.
- Each customer order has:
  - An **order time** (when the customer places the order).
  - A **travel time** (time taken by the delivery boy to deliver the order).
- Delivery boys:
  - Each delivery boy starts as **free** at time `0`.
  - When a delivery boy is assigned, he becomes available again only after completing the delivery.
- Orders are assigned in the following way:
  - The **first available delivery boy (lowest ID)** is assigned.
  - If no delivery boy is available, the order fails (`No Food :-(`).
